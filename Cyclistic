--This is the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Program Portfolio Project. The sample data provided (URL provided below) follows the Bike Share usage of fictional company, Cyclistic. The 
--stakeholders (Cyclistic Marketing) are interested in the correlation between Bike Share usage and membership status. Since members bring in the larger percentage of the companies revenue, it is desired to
--find a way to convert more casual riders to members. For this project, the previous 12 months of Bike Share data have been combined for analysis.
